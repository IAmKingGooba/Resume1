    <h4 class="sum">I'm someone who love's to learn and always will consider and most often take on a challenge, from learning something new to being competive during a basketball game. I personally find displeasure in leaving something unresolved whether it might be a puzzle or a disagreement It's hard for me to part with anything unsolved or unfinished. I strive to have a ever growing work ethic to take on new and harder challenges.</h4>
